## What is biblicalhumanities.org?

biblicalhumanities.org is a group of computer scientists, Bible scholars, and digital humanists collaborating to create open digital resources for biblical studies.  Our emphasis is on open resources for biblical languages, such as morphologically tagged texts, treebanks, and lexicons.

We are working to grow a community, not to own it or control it.  We try to create resources that are missing, and help people coordinate with
others who are working on similar things to maximize interoperability and minimize duplication of effort.

We work with projects that meet the following criteria:

- Freely licensed
- Human readable formats like XML, JSON, or well structured HTML with metadata
- Publicly available in source code repositories
- Designed to be used collaboratively with other resources

## Who is biblicalhumanities.org?

biblicalhumanities.org was founded in 2012 when Randall Tan (a linguist)  and Jonathan Robie (a computer scientist) wanted to publish a set of SBLGNT treebanks created by the Global Bible Initiative.
