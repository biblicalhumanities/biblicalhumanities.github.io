## What is biblicalhumanities.org?

biblicalhumanities.org is a community of computer scientists, Bible scholars, and digital humanists collaborating to create open digital resources for biblical studies.  Our emphasis is on open resources for biblical languages, such as morphologically tagged texts, treebanks, and lexicons. We hope that these resources will be used widely for teaching, research, and resources used to read and study the Bible.

We are working to grow a community, not to own it or control it.  We try to track resources that exist, create resources that are missing, and help people coordinate with
others who are working on similar things to maximize interoperability and minimize duplication of effort. See our [dashboard](/dashboard/) for an overview of these resources. We are now beginning to create standards to maximize interoperability among resources.

In addition, we sponsor two online forums for discussing biblical languages:

- [The B-Greek Forum](http://www.ibiblio.org/bgreek/forum/)
- [The B-Hebrew Forum](http://biblicalhumanities.org/bhebrew/)
