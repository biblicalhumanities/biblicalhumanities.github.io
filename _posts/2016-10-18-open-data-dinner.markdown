On Saturday, November 19th 2016, at 6:30 PM, a group of people who create open digital datasets or open source software for digital biblical studies will go out to dinner together.  The main purpose of this dinner is to discuss ways we can work together over the coming year to continue providing useful datasets and software, think about missing pieces, and find synergy between existing projects and initiatives. 

Please contact Jonathan <jonathan.robie@biblicalhumanities.org> or Randall <randall.tan@globalbibleinitiative.org> if you wish to attend.  RSVP strongly requested, since the restaurant has limited seating.  Participants should plan on paying for their meal (we are unable to cover the cost of the dinner).
