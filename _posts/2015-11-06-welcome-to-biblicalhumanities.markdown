Welcome to [biblicalhumanities.github.io](biblicalhumanities.github.io)!  If you are not familiar with us, check out the [about](/about/), [dashboard](/dashboard/), and [guidelines](/guidelines/) sections of this site.

Since January, 2013, we have been communicating using a phpBB forum at [biblicalhumanities.org](http://biblicalhumanities.org), but we have decided that it is time to improve our channels of communication. On this site, we will make announcements in this blog and track the progress of key projects in the dashboard. Eventually, this site will probably replace the phpBB forum entirely.

Interactive discussions are being conducted at [https://biblicalhumanities.slack.com/](https://biblicalhumanities.slack.com/).  Sign up for an account if you want to join us!
