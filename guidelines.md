Our mission is to grow an open data ecosystem for digital biblical studies. To support this mission, we promote these guidelines:

- Freely licensed. For content that is not code, we like [Creative Commons Licenses](http://creativecommons.org/choose/).  For code, we like MIT, Apache, and GPL -see [http://choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/).  We encourage licenses that require attribution, we dislike licenses that require asking permission - that just doesn't scale.
- Human readable formats like XML, JSON, or well structured HTML with metadata.
- Unicode, using NFC normalization and UTF-8 when feasible.
- Publicly available in source code repositories, so changes are visible and available, and it is easy to track issues and suggest improvements or corrections.
- Designed to be used collaboratively with other resources.
- Uses existing standards like TEI, Epidoc, and OSIS when they are a good match for the domain.

We are now beginning to negotiate standards to improve interoperability among resources.  Check out [https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/standards](https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/standards), and come talk to us on [https://biblicalhumanities.slack.com/messages/standards/](https://biblicalhumanities.slack.com/messages/standards/).
