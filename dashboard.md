This dashboard primarily lists data resources that are centrally important for digital biblical humanities and available now. Unless otherwise stated, they provide their data under open licenses. There are multiple versions of some of these resources, we attempt to point to the best authoritative source.  For Greek resources, [Perseus](https://github.com/PerseusDL/tei-conversion-tools/wiki) is well worth consulting as well.

If you believe a resource should be added to this page, please contact us (see the bottom of any page on this site for contact information).
